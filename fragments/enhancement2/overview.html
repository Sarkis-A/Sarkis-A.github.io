    The artifact I chose for enhancement is my Advising Assistance Program, which I initially developed in CS 300: Data
    Structures and Algorithms - Analysis and Design. The original version was contained in a single C++ file and
    utilized a hash table as the primary data structure for storing and retrieving courses. While this approach worked
    adequately for the smaller dataset of computer science courses I focused on at the time, it had significant
    limitations. The design lacked flexibility, and the code was tightly coupled, combining everything from the data
    model to file input and the menu system in a single location.
