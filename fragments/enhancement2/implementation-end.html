    The improvements are evident not only in the data structures but also in the overall organization of the program.
    Rather than keeping everything in a single file, I refactored the code into a modular design, creating separate
    header and source files for each component. This separation of concerns makes the project easier to maintain,
    extend, and test. The difference in structure is particularly noticeable when comparing the original primary
    function to its enhanced version, where initialization and interaction with the menu are clearly separated.
