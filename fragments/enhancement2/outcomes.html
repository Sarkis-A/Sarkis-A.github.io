    Through this enhancement process, I demonstrated my capability to design and evaluate computing solutions using
    algorithmic principles while managing the trade-offs involved in data structure design. The project highlighted the
    differences between the hash table's average-case constant-time lookups (O(1), but O(n) in the worst case) and the
    Red-Black Tree's guaranteed logarithmic performance for search/insert/delete (O(log n)), along with the natural
    in-order traversal and range-query benefits the tree provides (O(n) traversal). This work aligns directly with
    course outcomes, showcasing my ability to select appropriate data structures, weigh their trade-offs, and apply them
    to address real-world scalability concerns.
