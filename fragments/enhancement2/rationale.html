    I included this artifact in my ePortfolio to demonstrate my growth in applying algorithms and data structures to
    solve practical problems. In the original program, the hash table served as the primary data structure. Although it
    was effective for smaller datasets, its limitations became apparent, particularly in terms of flexibility and
    performance under certain conditions. In the enhanced version, I implemented a Red-Black Tree, which required me to
    grasp advanced concepts such as rotations and recoloring to maintain balance.
