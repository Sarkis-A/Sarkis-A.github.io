<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Artifact Code Review</h2>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
    An integral part of my development process was conducting a code review, where I examined my source code for
    readability, quality, and adherence to best practices. This review helped me identify areas for improvement while
    reinforcing habits that lead to maintainable and professional code. It also highlighted the importance of
    collaboration, communication, and constructive feedback, which are essential to producing reliable software. The
    process allowed me to view my work through the lens of industry expectations and ensure that each artifact met
    professional standards of quality and consistency.
