<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Professional Reflection and Future Goals</h2>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
    Reflecting on my academic and professional journey, I see how each experience has contributed to my growth as both a
    developer and a problem solver. Through the projects in my ePortfolio and the skills I've acquired along the way, I
    have developed a strong appreciation for the structure and creativity inherent in computer science. I've learned
    that building software involves not only writing code but also designing solutions that are secure, efficient, and
    user-focused. This mindset now guides my approach to every projectâ€”whether I'm developing a new application,
    improving an existing system, or collaborating with others to achieve a common goal. The knowledge and skills I've
    gained throughout this program have provided a solid foundation for my future in software development. I am
    confident in my ability to analyze complex problems, design scalable solutions, and apply secure coding practices
    that meet professional standards. My experiences have also taught me the importance of lifelong learning and
    adaptability in a field that continues to evolve rapidly. I plan to further expand my expertise in mobile and
    full-stack development while staying current with emerging technologies that enhance performance, usability, and
    security.
