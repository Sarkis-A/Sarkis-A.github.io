    For this enhancement, we continued building on the Inventory App artifact, focusing more
    on the databases category. I integrated Cloud Firestore to enable real-time
    synchronization and cloud-based collaboration. This transformed the app from a
    single-user local system into a shared environment where users can manage group
    inventories with unique access permissions. To ensure data security, I wrote
    detailed Firestore Security Rules that define role-based permissions and validate
    user actions before allowing database operations.
