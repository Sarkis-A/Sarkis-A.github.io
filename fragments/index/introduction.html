<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Introduction</h2>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
    My journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been one of steady growth,
    discovery, and perseverance. Balancing full-time service in the United States Air Force with a demanding academic
    workload has taught me how to manage responsibilities, stay disciplined, and adapt quickly to new challenges. Over
    the past three years, I have developed not only strong technical skills but also a deep understanding of how to
    approach problems like an engineerâ€”methodically, creatively, and with a focus on long-term reliability.

    This program has transformed the way I think about technology and its impact. I have learned that building great
    software goes beyond simply writing functional code; it involves designing systems that are secure, efficient, and
    user-friendly. Through each course and project, I have strengthened my ability to analyze problems, apply the
    appropriate tools, and communicate solutions clearly. These experiences have helped me grow into a developer who
    values clean architecture, maintainability, and collaboration as much as technical precision.

    As I prepare to take the next step in my career, I am confident in my ability to contribute to meaningful software
    engineering projects. My education has equipped me with the tools to bridge technical expertise with real-world
    application, and my time in the Air Force has instilled the professionalism and accountability needed to thrive in a
    team-oriented, high-stakes environment. Together, these experiences have laid the foundation for a career built on
    innovation, integrity, and continuous improvement.
