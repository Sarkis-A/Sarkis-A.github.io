<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Introduction</h2>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
    My journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been one of steady growth,
    discovery, and perseverance. Balancing full-time service in the United States Air Force with a demanding academic
    workload taught me discipline and adaptability. Over the past three years, I have built strong technical skills and
    learned to approach problems with the mindset of an engineer: methodically, creatively, and with long-term
    reliability in mind. The program reshaped how I think about technology by showing me that great software is not just
    functional but secure, efficient, and user-centered. With each course and project, I continue to improve at breaking
    problems down, choosing the right tools, and communicating decisions clearly. As I progress in my career, I will
    continue to value clean architecture, maintainability, and teamwork. These experiences have prepared me for a career
    where I am confident in my ability to contribute to meaningful software engineering projects productively.
