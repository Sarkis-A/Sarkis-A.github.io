<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Core Competencies and Professional Skills</h2>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
    Over time, I have built a toolkit that blends technical depth with professional habits that teams rely on in
    software, which shows up as consistent naming, readable comments, and clear documentation. Communication is central
    to how I work, and I aim to make complex ideas easy to follow through architecture sketches, comments that explain
    tradeoffs, and short demos that walk through features. Technically, I have hands-on experience with software
    engineering principles, database design, and client-server architecture, and I care about writing code that scales
    without turning into a tangle. Security is an essential part of my process from the beginning, by identifying
    vulnerabilities early and applying secure practices throughout development. On the algorithm side, I enjoy selecting
    approaches that balance efficiency and clarity. Altogether, my style is structured, security-aware, and
    user-focused.
