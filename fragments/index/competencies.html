<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Core Competencies and Professional Skills</h2>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a robust skill set that showcases both my
    technical abilities and professional maturity. One of the most valuable lessons I have learned is that successful
    software development relies heavily on teamwork, effective communication, and a clear understanding of both user and
    system needs. My experience in the United States Air Force has enhanced my leadership skills, adaptability, and
    attention to detail, all of which directly influence my approach to collaboration and problem-solving in software
    development. I have learned to work effectively in team environments, contribute to shared goals, and maintain
    accountability at every stage of a project.

    Strong communication has been central to my success as a developer. Whether through technical documentation,
    explanations of design decisions, or engagement with peers during project reviews, I have cultivated the ability to
    translate complex technical concepts into clear, accessible language. This skill enables me to bridge the gap
    between technical teams and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that project requirements and expectations remain
    aligned from beginning to end.

    My coursework has provided me with practical experience in software engineering and database design, where I learned
    to plan, develop, and maintain scalable systems. I gained a solid understanding of relational and non-relational
    databases, client-server architecture, and the importance of building software that performs efficiently across
    platforms. These experiences have helped me adopt a mindset focused on designing solutions that are not only
    effective but also maintainable and secure.

    Additionally, I have made significant progress in understanding security. Through courses on secure coding
    practices, I learned to identify and prevent vulnerabilities early in the development process. I developed a deeper
    understanding of data protection, encryption, and authentication methods that safeguard both users and systems. This
    emphasis on security has become an integral part of how I design and evaluate software, ensuring that privacy and
    security are intrinsic to every project.

    Finally, my grasp of algorithms and logic has shaped my thinking as a developer. The ability to analyze a problem,
    select the most appropriate approach, and implement an efficient solution is something I apply at every stage of
    development. This analytical skill, combined with a focus on collaboration and security, defines my approach to
    software engineering.
