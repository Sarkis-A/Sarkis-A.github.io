<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Growth Through the Program</h2>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
    My time in college made my focus mature from "make it work" to "make it well." Early courses like IT-140:
    Introduction to Scripting built habits in logic, structure, and problem-solving. CS-250: Software Development
    Lifecycle and CS-255: System Analysis and Design pushed me to plan first and document decisions, which matches how I
    naturally operate: sketch the diagram, map the flow, then write the code. Later, CS-319: UI/UX Design and
    Development encouraged me to think like a user rather than only a developer. I began translating feedback into
    practical UI changes and accessibility improvements. This mix of system thinking and user empathy now guides my
    work, while leadership experience from the Air Force reinforced steady execution and accountability when
    requirements change. I leave the program equipped not only with technical proficiency but also with the confidence,
    professionalism, and mindset of a lifelong learner committed to continuous improvement.
