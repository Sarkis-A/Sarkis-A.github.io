    For this enhancement, I replaced the hash table in my Assistance Advising Program
    with a Red-Black Tree. This advanced self-balancing binary search tree maintains
    performance consistency through rotations and recoloring. This implementation
    provided faster, more reliable lookups even as the dataset grew. I also refactored
    the codebase into multiple source and header files, improving readability and
    maintainability. Benchmark testing showed measurable improvements in both efficiency
    and scalability.
