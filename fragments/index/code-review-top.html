<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Artifact Code Review</h2>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
    Before diving into the enhancements, I conducted a thorough code review as a key part of my development process.
    During this review, I assessed my source code for readability, quality, and adherence to best practices. This
    evaluation helped me identify areas for improvement and reinforced habits that contribute to writing maintainable
    and professional code. It highlighted the significance of collaboration, communication, and constructive feedback,
    all of which are crucial for developing reliable software. This process allowed me to view my work through the lens
    of industry expectations, ensuring that each artifact met professional standards of quality and consistency.
