<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Growth Through the Program</h2>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
    Reflecting on my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I see how much I've
    grown as both a learner and a developer. When I began the program, my primary focus was learning to write code and
    to turn an idea into a functional program. Early courses, such as IT-140: Introduction to Scripting, helped me build
    a solid foundation by teaching me the essential logic, structure, and problem-solving mindset that every programmer
    needs.

    As I progressed through the curriculum, my perspective shifted from merely writing code to comprehending how
    software fits into a larger system. In courses like CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle and CS-255: System
    Analysis and Design, I learned the importance of planning, documentation, and communication in bringing a project
    from concept to completion. These experiences taught me that successful software is not only functional but also
    well-organized, maintainable, and designed with a clear purpose.

    Later in the program, CS-319: UI/UX Design and Development challenged me to consider the user experience behind the
    code. I discovered that intuitive design and accessibility are just as vital as technical correctness. This insight
    has influenced my approach to every project, ensuring that usability and functionality work together to enhance the
    user experience.

    The combination of my coursework, hands-on projects, and professional experiences has shaped me into a well-rounded
    software developer ready to tackle real-world challenges. Through this program, I've learned to view problems from
    multiple perspectives, balancing user needs, system design, and long-term maintainability. My time at SNHU, along
    with the discipline and leadership skills I developed during my service in the Air Force, has prepared me to make
    meaningful contributions to the field of computer science. I leave the program equipped not only with technical
    proficiency but also with the confidence, professionalism, and mindset of a lifelong learner committed to continuous
    improvement.
