    Hi, I'm Austin, a developer who has taken a slightly unconventional path into the tech industry. For the past eight
    years, I have served full-time in the U.S. Air Force as an Avionics Backshop technician. This is where I learned to
    remain calm under pressure, communicate clearly, and deliver on time when it truly matters. This experience has
    shaped the way I build software: methodically, reliably, and with a strong focus on teamwork. Along the way, I
    earned my B.S. in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University, which provided me with a solid foundation
    for approaching problems like an engineer and instilled in me a curiosity for lifelong learning.

    Outside of work and school, I am a tinkerer at heart. I manage a small homelab to teach myself about networking and
    server administration, including VLANs, Docker containers, reverse proxies, and monitoring dashboards. I enjoy
    setting up services, breaking them, and then reassembling them to improve their performance. This hands-on approach
    helps me stay sharp on the fundamentals while experimenting with tools that are relevant to real projects.

    Most of my coding experience focuses on Android development and full-stack web work. I take pleasure in creating
    clean interfaces, building simple APIs, and writing code that remains easy to read even months later. Additionally,
    I have been exploring both home and business automation. When I'm not behind the keyboard, I usually spend my time
    outdoors or learning something new in technology. I love going for hikes and enjoying fresh air, then returning to
    delve into new networking concepts, read up on deployment tips, or experiment further in my homelab. When it's time
    to unwind, I enjoy watching a good movieâ€”anything from sci-fi to an engaging thriller.
