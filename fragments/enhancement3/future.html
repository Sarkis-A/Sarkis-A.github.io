    One additional challenge I encountered during development was the lack of middleware functionality between the
    client and the database. Currently, the app communicates directly with Firestore, which, while efficient for
    rapid prototyping, limits flexibility and complicates the handling of multi-step operations or advanced
    security logic. Without a middleware layer, such as Firebase Cloud Functions, certain actions—like cascading
    deletions, role changes, or complex validations—must be managed entirely on the client side, increasing the
    potential for inconsistencies and security risks. A future upgrade could introduce middleware services to
    handle these operations on the server side, improving both reliability and security by centralizing logic and
    reducing client exposure to sensitive database operations.
