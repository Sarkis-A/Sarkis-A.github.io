    The process of enhancing this artifact helped me strengthen my skills in secure data handling, authentication
    workflows, and scalable mobile development. One of the significant lessons I learned was how to balance
    accessibility and security when designing cloud databases for collaborative applications. Implementing
    role-based access controls and writing Firestore rules that seamlessly integrate with client-side logic
    required careful planning and iterative testing to ensure seamless integration. Another challenge was
    optimizing performance for larger inventories. To maintain responsiveness without overwhelming the user
    interface or database, pagination and real-time listeners proved essential. Debugging asynchronous Firestore
    operations and resolving permission errors deepened my understanding of how cloud databases manage concurrency
    and synchronization. Throughout the enhancement process, I faced several significant challenges that enriched
    my understanding of mobile software design and cloud database management. A primary difficulty was configuring
    Firestore Security Rules to strike a balance between accessibility and protection effectively, ensuring that
    group owners, admins, and members had the appropriate level of access required careful logic structuring and
    repeated testing, as even minor rule errors could block valid operations or expose sensitive data. Debugging
    permission issues was often complex because Firestore's error messages are intentionally broad, necessitating a
    step-by-step approach to identify where access was being denied.
