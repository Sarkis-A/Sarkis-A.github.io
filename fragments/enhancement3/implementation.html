    The enhancement involved transforming the local storage system into a cloud-connected application by using
    Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore. These integrations enabled per-user data storage, real-time
    synchronization, and secure access from multiple devices. Additionally, I implemented a group inventory system
    that allows multiple users to collaborate on shared inventories. Each group included role-based
    permissions—Owner, Admin, and Member—enforced by carefully structured Firestore Security Rules to protect data
    integrity and privacy. The app also gained functionalities like pagination and per-document listeners, which
    improved performance and scalability by loading data in small batches and updating only modified records rather
    than reloading entire datasets.
