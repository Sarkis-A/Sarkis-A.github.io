    The artifact I selected for this enhancement is an Android Inventory Tracking Application originally
    developed in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. The app was initially created as a standalone
    inventory manager, allowing users to add, edit, and delete items stored locally on their devices. It utilized
    basic on-device persistence to maintain inventory data and provided a straightforward interface for single-user
    use. However, the original version lacked multi-user functionality, device synchronization, and secure access
    controls, making it an ideal candidate for enhancement within the Databases category.
