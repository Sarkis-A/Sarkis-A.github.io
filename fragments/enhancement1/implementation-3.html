    The UI/UX code adheres to modern Kotlin conventions: string resources are centralized, naming is consistent, and
    KDoc headers provide clear descriptions of the purpose and usage at the beginning of key classes and functions. The
    outcome is a Kotlin-only codebase that features clear boundaries, safer null handling, and a stable foundation for
    future enhancements, such as implementing coroutines for asynchronous work and deeper integrations with
    Firebase.
