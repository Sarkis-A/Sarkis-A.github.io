    I laid the foundation for multi-device and multi-user collaboration by adding Firebase Authentication and wiring
    initial Firestore connections. Today, a single account can sign in on multiple devices and stay in sync for personal
    inventories, which demonstrates the core pattern for collaboration. The remaining group-inventory features (roles,
    shared lists, and access rules) are planned for the database-focused enhancement; however, the current refactor
    intentionally separates concerns (auth, data access, UI) so those collaborative capabilities can be added cleanly
    without rewriting the app.
