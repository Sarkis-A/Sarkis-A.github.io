    This version of the app already represents significant improvements, with even more impactful enhancements
    forthcoming as collaborative group inventories are fully integrated. The modernization to Kotlin, clearer
    architecture, and UI/UX refinements make the codebase easier to extend, test, and reviewâ€”so future features (like
    role-based sharing and real-time group sync) can be added with minimal friction. In short, the project is no longer
    just a functional prototype; it's a maintainable, production-ready foundation that delivers immediate usability
    gains while positioning the app for scalable collaboration in the next phase.
