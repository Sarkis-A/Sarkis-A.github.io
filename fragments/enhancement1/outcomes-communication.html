    I improved the clarity and consistency of the app's “voice” through UI/UX updates (labels, empty states, and error
    messages), standardized naming conventions, and a more coherent navigation structure. The screenshots, narrative,
    and commit history together communicate the intent and impact of the changes, while the redesigned screens present
    information more cleanly to non-technical users. These choices make the product easier to understand, test, and demo
    to different audiences.
