<p class="text-gray-800 leading-7">The hardest parts of this enhancement were the Kotlin migration, Firebase
    Authentication wiring, and stabilizing the build. Moving fully to Kotlin surfaced null-safety issues and outdated
    patterns; I addressed these by replacing legacy callbacks with clearer function boundaries, adding explicit
    nullability, and introducing simple data classes for request/response shapes. Integrating Firebase Auth (with Google
    sign-in) created Gradle and dependency conflicts; I resolved them by aligning BOM versions, isolating auth code
    behind a small Kotlin wrapper, and centralizing configuration so additional providers can be added with minimal
    changes. Finally, UI/UX refinements required reorganizing resources and standardizing strings, colors, and styles; I
    validated each screen end-to-end (login, guest mode, error states) to ensure a consistent “voice” and predictable
    navigation. These steps collectively improved reliability, maintainability, and readiness for the upcoming
    collaborative features.
