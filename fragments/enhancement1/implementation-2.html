    The authentication flow was rebuilt in Kotlin using Firebase Auth. Inputs are validated before any network calls are
    made, and the success and error paths are clearly separated. Guest mode is supported through SharedPreferences.
    Additionally, I integrated the Google sign-in provider and organized the authentication layer so that additional
    providers can be activated with minimal changes.
