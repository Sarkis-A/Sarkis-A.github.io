    I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it showcases the entire progression of a project, from its initial
    creation to its modernization and expansion. It demonstrates my ability to refactor an existing codebase while also
    laying the groundwork for new features. The enhancements highlight several skills I have developed as a programmer,
    including migrating the project from Java to Kotlin for improved type safety and maintainability, updating naming
    conventions and architecture for clarity, and redesigning the UI and UX to provide a more professional and
    user-friendly experience. I also incorporated Firebase Authentication and Firestore connections, preparing the app
    for future real-time synchronization and collaborative inventories, although that functionality will expand further
    in later enhancements. These improvements demonstrate my growth in architecture, coding, and design, as well as my
    ability to prepare software for long-term scalability.
