    I migrated the codebase from Java to Kotlin to gain null safety, concise data models, and better long-term
    maintainability. I resolved Gradle and dependency issues introduced by integrating Firebase Authentication and
    prepared Firestore data access for future real-time sync. Alongside architectural cleanup, I removed redundant
    dependencies and simplified layouts. Collectively, these choices apply well-founded, industry-relevant tools and
    practices to deliver a more robust, extensible mobile app.
